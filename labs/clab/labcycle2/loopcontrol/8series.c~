Read value of x and number of terms N
For iterative computation of the sum, we will set
- value of term to 1 (the first term)
- sum to 0
- a counter variable k to 1
At the begining of each iteration, we will check
- if no of terms is less than or equal to N do the followiing
sum = sum + term;
term = (term * (-x*x))
